# Wedal Joomla Callback â€“ Popup Callback Form

<p>Wedal Joomla Callback is the popup callback form for your Joomla site.</p>
<p>The module is free. It is easy to install and configure. Now you can get an excellent contact form on the site with just a few clicks.</p>
<p>In the process of working on different client sites, I constantly needed a simple and easy feedback module that would work with AJAX. The main purpose of creating this module was the simplicity of customization to the requirements of the customer.</p>
<p>Wedal Joomla Callback I did first of all for myself, for the convenience of work. But I decided that it would be great to share the module with the community.</p>
<h2>Features Wedal Joomla Callback</h2>
<h3>1. Only module and nothing else</h3>
<p>The feedback form is implemented using a single module. There are no additional components, plug-ins, etc.</p>
<h3>2. The module works completely on AJAX</h3>
<p>It does not load with the page. Only the form call button with the following code is loaded:</p>
<pre class="brush:xml">&lt;div id="WJC102" data-id="102" class="wjcallback "&gt;
    &lt;a class="wjcallback-link" href="#"&gt;Get Callback&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p>There is no weighting of the page with hidden forms. The call code does not include the link to the form or the form code at all, which will prevent most robots sending spam from seeing the form.</p>
<p>When you click on the button, the form is loaded in real time.</p>
<p>After submitting the form, the page does not reload.</p>
<h3>3. On the page there can be an unlimited number of different forms with different design and only one JS and one CSS file</h3>
<p>You can create multiple copies of the module on the same page with different settings. And yes, they will work. In this case, all forms will be processed by the common JS-file, which will be loaded one time.</p>
<p>Why is this cool? Now you can add a couple of contact forms in the header of the site, several in the text, and another one in the footer with the one single module duplicated in the admin panel. This almost does not make the page heavier (see above). This will not require heaps of scripts.</p>
<h3>4. Each form, button, letter can have a unique structure and design</h3>
<p>Wedal Joomla Callback supports alternative layouts for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Callback buttons</li>
<li>Callback forms</li>
<li>Callback letters</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, only one module and an unlimited number of different forms.</p>
<h3>5. Spam and CSRF protection</h3>
<p>There is no special antispam protection, but only robots that know how to execute the JS code will be able to see the form and come up with a click on an empty link. If you get spam, then a little and rarely, mostly manual human. But your users will not bother solving the captcha code from the image to contact you.</p>
<p>In addition, a token check has been implemented in the module, which will not allow performing CSRF attacks.</p>
<h3>6. Other</h3>
<p>Another feature is the simplicity of the module. It does not allow you to create an unlimited set of unique fields, but in the layouts you immediately see each individual field, and are able to quickly influence its handler. This will allow you to easily add a module with the necessary unique functionality and customize it for the task.</p>

<p>They are very simple and do not require additional explanations. If you wish, you can not configure anything at all, but only install and publish the module. After that, it will already work.</p>
<p>As I wrote above, you can create several copies of the module in the admin panel and set different settings for them, and display them on one page. This will work too.</p>
<p>Several modules on one page:</p>
